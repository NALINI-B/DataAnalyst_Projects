Complex Data Analytics Project:-

E-commerce Product Recommendation System

Objective: Develop a personalized product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform.

Key Tasks and Technologies:-

1. Data Collection:

   - SQL: Extract transactional data, user behavior data, and product catalog data from the database.

   - Sample Data Source: Kaggle datasets (e.g., "Retail Rocket Recommender System Dataset").

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

   - Python (Pandas): Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn): Conduct EDA to understand user behavior and product interactions.

4. Model Building:

   - Python (Scikit-learn, Surprise): Build collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation models.

5. Evaluation:

   - Python (Scikit-learn): Evaluate the models using metrics like RMSE, precision, and recall.

6. Visualization:

   - Power BI: Create interactive dashboards to visualize user segments, popular products, and recommendation performance.

7. Reporting:

   - Excel: Summarize key findings and insights in a report, highlighting the impact on user engagement and sales.

Steps to Implement:-

1. Extract and preprocess data using SQL and Python.

2. Perform EDA and visualize insights using Python.

3. Build and evaluate recommendation models using Python.

4. Create interactive dashboards in Power BI.

5. Summarize findings in Excel and prepare a report.

Tips for Adding Projects to Resume:-

- Title and Duration: Clearly mention the project title and duration.

- Objective: Briefly state the project's objective.

- Tools and Technologies: List the tools and technologies used.

- Key Tasks: Bullet points describing major tasks performed.

- Key Findings: Highlight key insights and results.

- Impact: Quantify the project's impact if possible.

Sample Data Sources:-

- Kaggle: Offers a variety of datasets for e-commerce and fraud detection projects.

- UCI Machine Learning Repository: Another source for diverse datasets.
